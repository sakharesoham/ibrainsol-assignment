I-Brain Solutions Interview Assignment

I have used ASP.NET for creation of the User Interface and SQL SERVER for database section.
As the assignment had total of 5 tasks to complete, out of which 3 were to display on UI while rest 2 to be solved using queries.
The tasks to be displayed are named as Task1.aspx, Task2.aspx, Task4.aspx respectively, in the TaskUI Folder.
Queries are stored in the 'Database' Folder, each one being solved individually.
